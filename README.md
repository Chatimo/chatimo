# Chatimo Free Text Chat And Calls

Source code for chatimo, the free chat texting app.

We know who's trending and who's not, this was made for developers to make out of their own.

This is the javascript and localhost version, using your own localhost server.

127.0.0.1 is also used in this application.

This is also known as a test edition, this will not work with any other clients.

There is no server to hold the connection between you and the other client, (e.g, your friend).

This application is  allowed open-source in the javascript and python version, or an other version we say you can.
